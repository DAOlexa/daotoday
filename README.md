[**DAO Today**](http://daotoday.io/) podcast was specially designed to dive deeper into the DAO universe. DAOs are a novel concept that we’ve been experimenting with for a while, but we are still unable to fully understand what they are and how they work. 

DAOs are here to change the corporate world that we know today, remove its limitations and bring more freedoms to us involved.

But in order for us to get to that point, we need to learn how to build DAOs in a healthy and sustainable manner, we need to understand DAOs for what they are, the power of the community, what the challenges of this environment are - and how to navigate them.

The goal of DAO Today podcast is to educate on DAOs and how they operate, discuss their onchain and offchain challenges, and of the blockchain industry as a whole. 

DAOs, decentralized autonomous organizations, are blockchain-governed, community owned organizations made by the people for the people who share the same mission and vision. You will usually hear that the DAO is a code embedded in smart contracts, but I am here to tell you that DAOs are a lot more. 

There are two layers to every DAO - its tech, and its community. Community is a key component of just about any DAO, and the code is there to govern that community in an autonomous manner lessening the need for human involvement and execution aiding higher transparency and the ability to build trustlessly but still with trust. For a DAO to be a healthy DAO, it needs  tech, a product that solves a real problem, and a supportive community to build and deliver that solution while weathering the industry’s storms.

Being a novel structure, DAOs are still finding their way and facing many challenges, both onchain and offchain. 

The onchain challenges are mainly how to build a DAO that is true to its nature, without hindering its effectiveness and growth.  The governance, the rules and behavior of the DAO, is the smart contract code that is executed autonomously; but the operations of a DAO, a community-based structure, is human powered and the risk of centralization happens exactly there. 

On the other hand, being in a gray regulatory area for so long, blockchain industry as a whole is experiencing a fair share of legal and compliance challenges with no clear guidance on how to navigate them, how to protect ourselves and our projects, and be on the good side of the law without compromising the ethos that we are building upon.

In the DAO Today podcast, you will have an opportunity to hear from people who have been building in the space for some time, from those that are just getting started, from legal and compliance and other professionals, and many more.

If you are new to this environment, the DAO Today podcast may help  and pave your way into this beautiful space.
